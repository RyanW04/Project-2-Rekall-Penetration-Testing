# Project-2-Rekall-Penetration-Testing
Used a private environment to test Rekall's Web servers, Windows Machines, and Linux Machines for any exploits that may be available. 
I was tasked with exploiting at least 20 different vulnerabilities within Rekall's environment to show weaknesses and offer solutions.
